# Plesk Post-Deployment Hook Configuration
# 
# This file tells Plesk which script to run after deployment
# Configure this in Plesk Git settings:
# 
# 1. Go to Plesk Panel → Git → your repository
# 2. Set "Actions after Git push" to "Run script"
# 3. Set script path to: ./post_deploy.sh
# 
# Or add this to your .plesk.yml file:
# 
# hooks:
#   post_deploy:
#     - ./post_deploy.sh
# 
# The post_deploy.sh script will:
# ✅ Set proper file permissions
# ✅ Clean up old php_interface directory
# ✅ Set up Python virtual environment
# ✅ Install required packages
# ✅ Test optimization engine
# ✅ Create deployment status report
