## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to web server**: Configure Apache/Nginx to serve from php_interface/
2. **Test database connection**: Visit test_connection.php to verify connectivity
3. **Customize as needed**: Modify colors, add features, integrate with Python backend
4. **Production hardening**: Add CSRF protection, rate limiting, audit logging

## Integration with Python Backend

The PHP interface works alongside the Python application:
- **Shared database schema**: Both use the same MySQL tables
- **Complementary functionality**: PHP for direct management, Python for planning algorithms
- **Data compatibility**: Seamless data exchange between systems

## Documentation

- **PHP Interface**: Complete documentation in `php_interface/README.md`
- **Main Project**: Updated `README.md` with PHP interface section
- **Configuration**: Environment examples and setup guides
- **Troubleshooting**: Database connection testing and error handling

The PHP interface is now ready for production use with the specified database credentials!
